***Title of the project:** "Streamlit Based Stock Forecasting Dashboard"
**Description:** Stock price prediction is a stimulating and principal task for
investors and traders in financial markets. In this project, we
developed a multipage Streamlit web application that allows users
to access and analyze stock data, including stock price prediction,
comparison, and technical indicators. DL methods, specifically
LSTM models, were employed in our study to predict future stock
prices based on historical data. In addition to our application, it
provides users with technical indicators such as RSI, MFI,
Stochastics, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Standard Deviation, and
ADX to support their survey of the stock data.
The application contains a login feature to ensure that the users
have safe access to the application, with unique usernames and
strong passwords. After the login, to access all the information
the users can enter a stock ticker, involving a visualization of the
stock data and for their use, they can also download all the
relevant data. In addition to that, the multiple stock data in a
single graph provides a useful tool for investors and traders to
compare different stocks' performances the application allows
users to do a comparison of it. Then at last we have added some
other feature which is the Time range feature that allows users to
select certain dates of stock predictions.

**Mention the problem:** Develop a Streamlit-based stock forecasting dashboard equipped with stock price prediction, stock comparison, technical indicators, a stock revenue calculator, and the capability to download stock data. The goal is to provide investors, traders, and financial analysts with a user-friendly platform for comprehensive stock market analysis and informed decision-making.
 **Mentioning the severity of the problem and why we need solution for that** 
 There are Limited Stock Comparison Features ,Lack of Technical Indicators,Inefficient Stock Revenue Calculator,Limited Data Download Options.
 **Mention which gorup of people face that problem:** 
 our project provides an extensive and user-friendly tool by this the capitalists and
 traders in making informed decisions in financial markets are
supported.
**About the project:**
Multipage Streamlit web application that allows users
to access and analyze stock data, including stock price prediction,
comparison, and technical indicators.
**How it is solving the problem:**
It's a  user-friendly interface for users to access and
analyze stock data is provided by the system. To access a
variety of information, technical indicators, including a
visualization of the stock data, and stock price predictions
based on historical data the users can enter a stock ticker.
The users can pick certain time ranges for stock
predictions, can also download the data for their use and
can also compare multiple stocks' performance in a single graph.
**use cases:**
we believe that our application may be
helpful for financial institutions and businesses looking to
make informed investment decisions, in addition to
individual investors and traders. Our application may offer
insightful analyses and information to help them with their
decision-making.
The proposed system would be built to interact with
other programmes that traders and investors frequently use,
like Google Sheets and Excel. As a result, users will be able
to quickly import and export data and analysis from the
system into tools of their own. It also has User
authentication, real-time data updates, error handling,
accessibility.
**Technical implemntaion:**
**Mention the approach and how you have solved the problem with the technology:**
we used the MAPE metric, which is used to measure the average of
absolute percentage variance between predicted and actual
values. Our LSTM model achieved an average MAPE of
less than 5%, which is considered excellent in the field of
stock price prediction.we have analyzed the other conventional time-series models such as
ARIMA compared with our model's performance and
found that our LSTM model performed well.




**Techstacks used:**
Python programming
Time series model-Lstm
Streamlit- An open-source framework to web app.

**How to run locally:**
1.Open Anaconda Navigator where the virtual environment of yourproject is created.
2.Go to the project directory.
3.Run the file using command "streamlit run login.py"
4.you can access the interface easily .

**What's next ?**
The future, we intend to expand the functionality of our 
programme in the future by including more technical 
indicators, including further data sources, and increasing the 
precision of our forecasts. To further enhance our 
predictions, we also intend to investigate other DL 
approaches including CNN and hybrid models. We also 
intend to carry out more thorough analyses and assess the 
performance of our model in comparison to other cutting
edge strategies. 

**Declaration:**
We confirm that the project showcased here was either developed entirely during the hackathon or underwent significant updates within the hackathon timeframe. We understand that if any plagiarism from online sources is detected, our project will be disqualified, and our participation in the hackathon will be revoked.
